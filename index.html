                with the assistance of GrammieGram's public RESTful API.

              <h5>Co-Founder and Full Stack Developer, Summer 2018</h5>
              <h5>Grinnell, Iowa</h5>
              <p>
                I co-founded GrammieGram LLC in the spring of 2018 with 4 close friends. We founded
                GrammieGram with the goal of solving a problem for our CEO's grandmother; communication technology
                was too complicated. With our quest in hand, we set out to develop a communication platform
                optimized for the elderly, and designed to be as simple to use as possible.
                That summer, I worked at GrammieGram as a Full Stack developer, building the GrammieGram
                web app using Python and Django on the backend and JavaScript and Bootstrap on the frontend.
                Working remotely with a small team of people I trust and aiming to improve the lives of real people,
                I began to get a glimpse of what working as a software engineer really means.

              <h5>Grinnell, Iowa</h5>
              <p>
                With a partner, I developed a program that can train a Convolutional Neural Network
                to read text in scanned images of historical maps. Our mentor is researching a tool
                that can make text in historical maps searchable by being able to pick out and recognise
                the words in the map. However, due to a dearth of real training data, my partner and I were
                tasked with creating synthetic training data.
                Our project, MapTextSynthesizer, dynamically generates grey-scale, synthetic images containing
                text, which appear to be from historical maps. Training on MapTextSynthesizer generated data
                improved the accuracy of my mentor's CNN by 10% over results when trained on industry standard
                character recognition datasets.

              <p>
                Working quality assurance for the Grinnell student directory app (lovingly known as DB) taught me
                the importance and complexity of testing that is required for large-scale, or even just medium-scale
                software products. I spent a lot of time between classes learning how to use Espresso and Mockito to
                create unit and implementation tests for Android. Additionally, I got to work on a large code-base from which I
                learned many tips and tricks that I use in my own Android projects.

                really allowed me to get excited about a new project and see the breadth of

                Ultimate Frisbee was introduced to me in middle school gym class as the weird
                sport that didn't make any sense because no one knew the rules. Despite first impressions,
                I continued playing Ultimate among friends and in the local frisbee league. I went
                on to co-found my high school's Ultimate Frisbee club and we went on to compete at a
                state level. Now, I'm the captain of the Ultimate Frisbee open team at Grinnell College
                where I teach and refine the skills of new and returning players in planned tri-weekly
                practices. My favorite part of Ultimate is being part of a team and enabling our success.

                After watching a documentary on the adverse effects of animal agriculture on the
                environment, I decided to go Vegan&trade;. I joined the intersectional vegan club
                at Grinnell College and learned a lot more about how the actions of an individual
                can (and do) have an impact on the world, and the importance of self efficacy. Today,
                I co-lead the Grinnell Intersectional Vegans and help organize club meetings and events.

                I grew up with two cats, which undoubtedly kickstarted my love for animals
                and particularly cats. I've been volunteering at animal shelters since
                high school, so I knew that I had to go to a college where I could continue
                helping animals without homes. I can honestly say that PALS, the animal shelter
                near Grinnell College, played a part in my college decision and I have no regrets.
                I volunteer at PALS weekly, cleaning and socializing the amazing felines that live
                there. It is my bitter-sweet joy to get to know and care for cats at the shelter,
                and then see them adopted.
