        <h5>Grinnell, Iowa</h5>
        <p>
          Building on GrammieGram's mission of designing communication technology with ease of
          use at its core, I was put in charge of leading a brand-new team of 3 Android mobile developers.
          Our goal: designing and implementing every aspect of Android mobile version of the GrammieGram web app
          with the assistance of GrammieGram's public RESTful API.

          <h5>Co-Founder and Full Stack Developer, Summer 2018</h5>
          <h5>Grinnell, Iowa</h5>
          <p>
            I co-founded GrammieGram LLC in the spring of 2018 with 4 close friends. We founded
            GrammieGram with the goal of solving a problem for our CEO's grandmother; communication technology
            was too complicated. With our quest in hand, we set out to develop a communication platform
            optimized for the elderly, and designed to be as simple to use as possible.
            That summer, I worked at GrammieGram as a Full Stack developer, building the GrammieGram
            web app using Python and Django on the backend and JavaScript and Bootstrap on the frontend.
            Working remotely with a small team of people I trust and aiming to improve the lives of real people,
            I began to get a glimpse of what working as a software engineer really means.

          <h5>Research Assistant, Summer 2018</h5>
          <h5>Grinnell, Iowa</h5>
          <p>
            With a partner, I developed a program that can train a Convolutional Neural Network
            to read text in scanned images of historical maps. Our mentor is researching a tool
            that can make text in historical maps searchable by being able to pick out and recognise
            the words in the map. However, due to a dearth of real training data, my partner and I were
            tasked with creating synthetic training data.
            Our project, MapTextSynthesizer, dynamically generates grey-scale, synthetic images containing
            text, which appear to be from historical maps. Training on MapTextSynthesizer generated data
            improved the accuracy of my mentor's CNN by 10% over results when trained on industry standard
            character recognition datasets.

          <h5>Junior Android Developer, Since Spring 2018</h5>
          <h5>Grinnell, Iowa</h5>
          <p>
            Working quality assurance for the Grinnell student directory app (lovingly known as DB) taught me
            the importance and complexity of testing that is required for large-scale, or even just medium-scale
            software products. I spent a lot of time between classes learning how to use Espresso and Mockito to
            create unit and implementation tests for Android. Additionally, I got to work on a large code-base from which I
            learned many tips and tricks that I use in my own Android projects.

            Built during the fall 2018 HackUIowa hackathon, Compliance Accomplice is an email system
            middleware for detecting and archiving potential SEC compliance issues in a
            self-hosted email server using Natural Language Processing. Participating in a hackathon
            really allowed me to get excited about a new project and see the breadth of
            software development applications; not everything is reversing linked lists, eh?

        <p>
            Ultimate Frisbee was introduced to me in middle school gym class as the weird
            sport that didn't make any sense because no one knew the rules. Despite first impressions,
            I continued playing Ultimate among friends and in the local frisbee league. I went
            on to co-found my high school's Ultimate Frisbee club and we went on to compete at a
            state level. Now, I'm the captain of the Ultimate Frisbee open team at Grinnell College
            where I teach and refine the skills of both new and returning players. My favorite
            part of Ultimate is being part of a team and enabling our success.

            After watching a documentary on the adverse effects of animal agriculture on the
            environment, I decided to go Vegan&trade;. I joined the intersectional vegan club
            at Grinnell College and learned a lot more about how the actions of an individual
            can (and do) have an impact on the world, and the importance of self efficacy. Today,
            I co-lead the Grinnell Intersectional Vegans and help organize club meetings and events.

          <p>
            I grew up with two cats, which undoubtedly kickstarted my love for animals
            and particularly cats. I've been volunteering at animal shelters since
            high school, so I knew that I had to go to a college where I could continue
            helping animals without homes. I can honestly say that PALS, the animal shelter
            near Grinnell College, played a part in my college decision and I have no regrets.
            I volunteer at PALS weekly, cleaning and socializing the amazing felines that live
            there. It is my bitter-sweet joy to get to know and care for cats at the shelter,
            and then see them adopted.
